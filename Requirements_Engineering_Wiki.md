## Requirements Engineering

### Definition

**Requirements Engineering (RE)** is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It's a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that bridges the gap between the needs of stakeholders and the technical specifications required for software development.

### Key Activities in Requirements Engineering

1.  **Elicitation:** Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
2.  **Analysis:** Refining, clarifying, and organizing the requirements.
3.  **Specification:** Documenting the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner.
4.  **Validation:** Confirming that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs.
5.  **Management:** Managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

### Types of Requirements

*   **Functional Requirements:** Describe what the system *must do* (e.g., "The system shall allow users to log in").
*   **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** Describe *how* the system must perform a function (e.g., performance, security, usability).

### Requirements Elicitation Techniques

*   **Interviews:** One-on-one conversations with stakeholders.
*   **Surveys:** Questionnaires distributed to a large number of stakeholders.
*   **Workshops:** Collaborative sessions with a group of stakeholders.
*   **Prototyping:** Creating a working model of the system to get feedback from stakeholders.
*   **Observation:** Observing users as they perform their daily tasks.

### Agile Requirements Engineering

In Agile methodologies, RE is a continuous process.

*   **User Stories:** Short, simple descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the end-user.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Detailed conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered "done."
*   **Product Backlog:** A prioritized, evolving list of user stories.
*   **Product Owner:** The person responsible for managing the product backlog and ensuring that it reflects the needs of the stakeholders.

### Example: Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a Blog

**1. Functional Requirements**

*   The system shall allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
*   The system shall allow users to add comments to blog posts.
*   The system shall provide an RSS feed for blog posts.

**2. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:** The system shall load all pages in under 2 seconds.
*   **Security:** The system shall protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Usability:** The system shall be easy to use for non-technical users.

### Common Requirements Engineering Pitfalls

*   **Incomplete or ambiguous requirements.**
*   **Changing requirements.**
*   **Communication problems between stakeholders and developers.**
*   **Lack of user involvement.**

### Conclusion

Requirements Engineering is a foundational discipline in software development that ensures the right software is built to meet the right needs. By systematically eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing requirements, RE helps bridge the gap between business and technology, leading to more successful projects.
